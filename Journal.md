Session 1: 11th October 2016

Goal: create a hazard that kills the player.

Estimated time spent: 1 hrs 14 mins

It took me quite some time to figure out how to initiate a reset, however I eventually discovered that you need to reference that you are indeed, using the SceneMangement tool. Next I tried to introduce a screen fader to the screen; After a long and tedious struggle against the animator I realised that each object has their own animator, and the way you should reference them is by making the animation reference “Public” so that I can apply animation where I see fit.
